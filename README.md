This repository is primarily CMake code to build the dependencies of
[Tomviz project][tomviz], along with Tomviz itself. It is used to create
the binaries uploaded automatically after new merges to the main development
branch, as well as those uploaded in releases. It is not intended to be used
for development, the Tomviz project features a BUILDING.md file with
instructions for setting up a development build.

Most development happens in the main [Tomviz repository][tomviz_repo].
